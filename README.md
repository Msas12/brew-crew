# Brew Crew

## Description

Brew Crew is an application that provides search results for breweries based on a user's city or state input. First, a user will have to sign up for an account on the login page, and then they can use the search feature. Once a city or state is entered, several breweries will display on the page along with the website, directions, phone number, and/or a Lyft. In the future, there will be an option to save your favorite breweries and view them on a separate "Favorites" page.

This application was built with React, MongoDB, OpenBreweryDB API, OpenGraph API, Node, and several other technologies.
